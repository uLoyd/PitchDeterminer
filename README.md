###What's here?  
A package handling audio. Live input processing, files, IO devices, sound curves, you name it.

Everything significant is here ->
[Package ReadMe](https://github.com/DawidPartyka/PitchDeterminer/tree/master/customModules/audioModules#readme)  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-works

All the other files outside audioModules directory are irrelevant as those 
exist just for myself to check out how the app using this package works (+ basic tests).
